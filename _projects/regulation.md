goal: >

    This project aims to extend the concept of algorithmic regulation, namely the use of computational systems like AI and big data, to gather information, set standards, and modify human behavior, as reflected in Uber's management of drivers. The study discusses the notion of platform neutrality and how digital platforms alter the social order, prompting questions about more democratic and transparent models of governance.

approach: >

    The analytical framework is based on a datailed case analysis of Uber's driver management, using publicly available documents, relevant literature, and diverse stakeholder reports. This approach characterizes the systems of regulation based on their design principles, rather than their causal links or direct outcomes.
