I"s<p>Digital technologies today are mostly developed by large technology corporations or by state actors, which often means that the user and citizen concerns are not at the center of attention. But what happens when civil society develops or operates their own digital technologies? This project addresses this question and examines the specific forms of digital design that emerge from civil society contexts. The innovation of the project lies in systematically analyzing the role of civil society in the development of digital technologies. Building on social science theories of civil society in democracies (Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, Jürgen Habermas, Nancy Fraser), the project asks whether digital applications created in this sphere better represent the interests of citizens, foster pluralistic participation – or, conversely, risk reinforcing societal polarization.</p>
