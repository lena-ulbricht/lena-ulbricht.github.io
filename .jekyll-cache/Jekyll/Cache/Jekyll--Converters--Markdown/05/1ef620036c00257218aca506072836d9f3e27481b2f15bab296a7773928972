        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Lena Ulbricht, a Political of Political Science at the University of Hildesheim and Digital Policy Expert.</p>
        <p>My research focuses on how digital transformation shapes democracies. I analyze the relationship between AI and democratic change, emerging trends in the regulation of technology and platforms, and innovative methods for political science research on digitalization.</p>
        <p>Previously, I led a research group at the Weizenbaum Institute for the Networked Society in Berlin and served as an associate researcher at the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB). From 2023 to 2024, I held the professorship for Political Theory and Philosophy at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). I earned my PhD from Humboldt University Berlin and completed an habilitation in Political Science at the University of Bremen. Beyond academia, I have also worked for the OECD, the Expert Commission on Research and Innovation, and VDI-VDE-IT GmbH.</p>
