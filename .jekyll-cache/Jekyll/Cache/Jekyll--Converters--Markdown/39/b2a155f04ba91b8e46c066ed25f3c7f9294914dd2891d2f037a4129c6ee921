<p>The  project explores the role of civil society organizations in addressing disinformation within the highly polarized societies of Latin America. While most existing studies on disinformation focus on state regulation or the self-regulation of media and platform companies, this project shifts attention to the still under-researched activities of civil society. The projectâ€™s innovative contribution lies in systematically documenting and theoretically framing civil society engagement. It asks to what extent civil society organizations fulfill their democratic mandate to strengthen social cohesion. The results indicate that civil society plays a crucial role, particularly as social intermediaries and organizers. CSOs detect polarization at an early stage, enhance digital competencies, foster political education, and support independent local journalism. In these ways, they make an indispensable contribution to democratic resilience in polarized societies.</p>
