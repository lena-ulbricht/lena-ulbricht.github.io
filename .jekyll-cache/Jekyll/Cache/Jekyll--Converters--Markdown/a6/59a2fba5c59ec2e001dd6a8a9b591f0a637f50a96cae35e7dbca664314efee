            <p>I am Professor of Political Science and Digital Technologies at the University of Hildesheim, based in Berlin. My work explores how digital technologies interact with democracyâ€”shaping political norms, practices, and regulation. I am especially interested in the politics of technology governance and how rules for digital platforms are debated and implemented. Recently, I have studied platform types that are rarely in the spotlight, including public security platforms, gaming platforms, and online pornography platforms. I also develop innovative methods and datasets to better understand digitalization in political life.</p>
            <p>Before joining Hildesheim, I led two research groups at the Weizenbaum Institute in Berlin and worked as a researcher at the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB). I have also held a professorship at the Technical University of Munich, and my academic path includes a PhD from Humboldt University of Berlin and a habilitation from the University of Bremen. Beyond academia, I have contributed expertise to the OECD, the German Expert Commission on Research and Innovation, and VDI-VDE-IT GmbH.</p>
            <p>I grew up in a Chilean-German family and now live in Berlin with my children. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree from Sciences Po in Paris and a Masterâ€™s degree in Political Science from Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. Earlier in my education, I attended a French school in Berlin and later spent two years living in Paris. Alongside my scientific work, I play basketball and enjoy music by Violeta Parra. I also co-host the podcast <a href="https://purplecode.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PurpleCode (with Bianca Herlo and Sana Ahmed)</a>.</p>
