I"…<p>While social media and gig economy platforms have already been widely discussed in both academia and politics, gaming platforms have remained largely overlooked. This research gap is particularly striking given that gaming platforms not only have vast reach but also differ in fundamental ways from other types of platforms. The central innovation of the project lies in the systematic analysis of gaming platforms as an independent field of platform regulation. Rather than treating them merely as a subcategory of social media or entertainment services, the project examines their distinctive functional logic. Gaming platforms are not simply spaces for play: they facilitate game creation, enable economic transactions, support forms of collective action, provide venues for commercial and political advertising, and are increasingly used for recruitment purposesâ€”whether by educational institutions or military organizations.
Because they frequently attract a very young audience, gaming platforms also raise pressing questions of participation and protection. The project therefore explores not only the risks associated with these environments but also the role of platform-specific design in shaping such dynamics. On this basis, it considers multiple regulatory approaches, including state interventions, self-regulation by platform operators, and contributions from civil society organizations.</p>
