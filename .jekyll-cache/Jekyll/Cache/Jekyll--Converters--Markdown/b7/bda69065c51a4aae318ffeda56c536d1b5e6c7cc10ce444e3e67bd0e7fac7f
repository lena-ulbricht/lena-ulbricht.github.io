I"Û<p>The research project advances theories of technology and platform regulation through the lens of feminist democratic theory. Much of the recent scholarship on digital platform regulation is rooted in liberal conceptions of political order, which primarily emphasize individual rights and protections against state intervention. This perspective, however, often overlooks the social power relations and structural inequalities that fundamentally shape digital technologies and their uses. The project therefore explores how feminist currents within democratic theory can expand these debates. Feminist approaches foreground the systemic dimensions of domination, which are not only gender-based but also intersect with class, origin, and racialized belonging. A feminist perspective on digital platforms makes it possible to grasp the social dynamics and power structures that operate beyond individual liberties, while simultaneously opening up new avenues for collective agency.</p>
