In addition, regime theory and democratic theory provide key analytical lenses. Empirically, the project relies on case studies. These include strategies of the European Union to promote artificial intelligence while simultaneously tailoring it to European values and norms. Another area of investigation is the development of “sovereign digital infrastructures.” A further example concerns citizen and identity databases, which profoundly shape the relationship between the state and the individual.</p>
