I"∞<p>Goal: This project aims to extend the concept of algorithmic regulation, namely the use of computational systems like AI and big data, to guide behavior, manage risks and shape the social order, as reflected in Uber's management of drivers. The study discusses the notion of platform neutrality and how digital platforms gather information, set standards, and modify human behavior, prompting questions about more democratic and transparent models of governance.</p>

<p>Approach: The analytical framework is based on a datailed case analysis of Uber's managing of drivers, using publicly available documents, reports from diverse stakeholders, and relevant academic literature. This allows to characterize the systems of regulation based on their design principles, rather than their causal links or direct outcomes.</p>
